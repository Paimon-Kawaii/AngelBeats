// Rearrange order to your preference for each Special Infected class.
// You can set any number of "order" values, all are not required to be entered.
// When no order value is matched, the Special Infected will default to using the games internal targeting logic.
//
// Order:		Prioritise who to attack first:
// 				1	= Normal Survivor.
// 				2	= Vomited Survivor.
// 				3	= Incapacitated Survivor.
// 				4	= Survivor Pinned (by Smoker, Hunter, Charger, Jockey).
// 				5	= Ledge hanging Survivor.
// 				6	= Vomited Special Infected.
// 				7	= Last Attacker.
// 				8	= Lowest Health Survivor.
// 				9	= Highest Health Survivor.
// 				10	= Survivor being Pummelled by Charger.
// 				11	= Survivor mounted on a Mini Gun.
//
// Pinned:		Ignore attacking target when they're pinned by: 1=Smoker. 2=Hunter. 4=Jockey. 8=Charger. 15=All. Add numbers together.
// Incap:		0=Ignore incapacitated players. 1=Allow attacking incapacitated players. 2=Only attack incapacitated players when they are vomited. 3=Only attack incapacitated when everyone is incapacitated.
// Voms:		0=Off. 1=Allow attacking vomited Special Infected (order number 6).
// Voms2:		0=Ignore attacking if target is currently covered in bile. 1=Allow attacking vomited incapacitated Survivors.
// Range:		0.0=No limit. The maximum range to target someone, otherwise the plugin defaults to the games internal mechanics for targeting someone.
// Wait:		How many seconds to target someone before being allowed to switch to another target. They will switch before if the player is no longer valid or allowed to be targeted.
// Last:		0=Off. 1=Allow targeting the last attacker using order value 7. Does not change if a target is already very close (250 units).
// Safe:		0=Allow attacking players in the saferoom. 1=Don't attack players in the saferoom.
