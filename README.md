## New Pills Coop
> This is a new pills coop **based on `Zonemod`**.  
> It uses **`Anne`'s _7-7_ plugin** to spawn infected.  
> It **looks like `Ast` but more difficult than `Ast`**.  
> It likely won't spawn infected if survivors can see them, but because of anne, it will teleport infected, so maybe TP on your face?? XD.  

## Reason
> I made this coop because `AnneHappy` is **unfriendly** to survivor since _11-28_ plugin.  
> `AnneHappy` now spawn infected in an **_unfriendly way_**, such as spawn **on your face** and **on your back**.  
> **Hard is needed**, but **_not in this way_**. That's why I made `AngelBeats`.
